**Datasets** contains all initially scraped and downloaded data
This includes finacial metrics in the economics folder
and tweets in in both tweet_scrape and twitter scraping

**mergedData** holds the csv files used to train the model
it currently only includes the financial metrics due to difficulty
with the standfordNLP API

**mysite** houses the front end created using the Django framework.
It is based on and updated via SQLite
